First, I’d make a visual plan of the refurbishment, including making a detailed list of all the things needed in the process.
Then, I’d order the necessities such as new furniture from online sites. I’d definetely prefer them to be minimalist and elegant. I’d also like to customize a few elements, for instance a desk with an electric frame, which is why I’d purchase the equipment required by myself at the hardware shop. I’d get a new computer set as well.
Next, I’d prepare the room for renovation by disposing of old furniture. I’d secure the floor and outlets to prevent them from damages and smudges.
Once the room is ready I’d start with clearcoling the walls and repainting them in HEX #2c2d2d (Dark Charcoal). After the paint dries out, I’d arrange the new furniture inside following the premade visual plan.
Lastly, I’d add some decorative accents like retro posters and a bonsai tree. Another great touch would be installing a projector to the ceilling with a remote screen.
